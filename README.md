## Introduction

This **Telegram bot** is designed to automatically fetch and post incidents from the [SPIN3](https://spin3.sos112.si) RSS system to a designated Telegram supergroup and its topics.

Contributions of any kind (feedback, code contributions, donations, etc.) are welcome and greatly appreciated! 

## Features

- Automatically fetches incidents from SPIN3 every 180 sec and posts them to a Telegram supergroup SPIN.
- Supports categorization of incidents by region and intervention type.
- Uses a custom `topics` dictionary to map various keywords in incidents to specific Telegram topics.
- Creates and posts static map images for incidents with GPS coordinates, including:
  - Point markers for individual incident locations as specified in the report.
  - Polygon boundaries for larger incidents (e.g., "Veƒçji obseg" events) to show the manicipality of the major event.
- Posts only new incidents and keeps track of already posted incidents using JSON files.
